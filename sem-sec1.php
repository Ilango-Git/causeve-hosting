						<h5 style="text-align: center;">Setting up your Advertisement</h5>			
						<p style="text-align: center;">Google Adwords allows you to decide where your advertisement will feature by bidding for several permutations of keywords. With a good strategy, your advertisement will land amongst the top results in the search engine results page (SERP), which is critical since most users do not go beyond page 1 of the search results.</p>

						<h5 style="text-align: center;">Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Advertising</h5>			
						<p style="text-align: center;">Using a Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Model, you decide where your advertisement will feature by bidding several permutations of keywords and only pay the amount you have set for the keyword if someone clicks on your advertisement as a result of web search. This creates a lean and efficient budget for your Search Engine Marketing campaign.</p>
